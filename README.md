# Human-Resource-Analysis
Problem 
•	The project was commissioned to uncover the factors that lead to employee attrition and explore important questions such as ‘show me a breakdown of distance from home by job role and attrition’ or ‘compare average monthly income by education and attrition.

Insights
•	The sales department accounts for 21% of total attrition rate in the company with a total of 92 people leaving the company,
•	With the highest rate of 3.4% within the $2,000 and $5,000 monthly income bracket and the lowest rate (0.2%) within the $19,000 - $20,000 monthly income bracket.
•	We can safely conclude that monthly income is a key driver to the attrition rate in the Sales Department as we see (i) a downward trend and (ii) a reduction in the percentage change of attrition rate as monthly income increases
